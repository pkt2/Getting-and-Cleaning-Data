Information about the project

The project is about the 30 volunteers within an age range of 19-48 years. Each person has performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
 
It has been created same as described like-
1 Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
